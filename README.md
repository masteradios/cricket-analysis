# Cricket Data Analysis Project with Power BI

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing cricket data using Power BI. The dataset comprises four main components: match-results, bowling_data, batting_data, and player_information. Through this analysis, we aim to derive insights into player performance, team dynamics, and overall match outcomes.
